# Agentic-AI-System
AI berbasis multi-agent. Setiap agent (Planner, Executor, Designer, dll) memiliki peran dan instruksi jelas, dikendalikan oleh Agent Base dan dikoordinasi melalui arsitektur cerdas.
# üß† Agentic AI System ‚Äì Prompt Architecture

## Overview
This repository/document contains a **comprehensive prompt schema** for building an **Agentic AI System** based on modular agents. Each agent serves a specific function and is coordinated by a central orchestrator (Agent Base) to perform complex tasks efficiently.

Designed for integration with tools like **LangGraph**, **AutoGen**, **CrewAI**, or custom-built LLM stacks.

## üß© Core Components

| Agent Name          | Role/Function                                                |
|---------------------|--------------------------------------------------------------|
| Agent Base          | Master controller and task coordinator                       |
| Dynamic Agent Factory | Spawns new agents based on task and role                   |
| Agent 02 (Meta-Spawner) | Monitors performance and bottlenecks                   |
| Prompt Library      | Provides context-specific prompt templates                   |
| Knowledge Base (RAG DB) | Retrieves semantic data context for each task          |
| Agent 03 (Planner)  | Breaks down goals into executable steps                      |
| Agent 04 (Executor) | Runs scripts, APIs, tools, or automation pipelines           |
| Agent 05 (Designer) | Produces visual assets: UI, diagrams, infographics           |
| Agent 06 (Specialist)| Provides expertise in security, law, AI tuning, etc.        |
| Output Handler      | Finalizes and formats deliverables                           |
